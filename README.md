# Coffee Sales Data Analysis (By using SQL in MySQL)
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a coffee sales dataset using SQL. The dataset contains transactional details such as date, time, coffee type, payment method (cash/card), amount, and customer identifiers (card numbers). The analysis includes data cleaning (handling missing values, date formatting), summarization, trend identification, customer behavior analysis, and revenue insights. The project was executed in a structured SQL environment using MySQL.

# Final Observations & Storyline

In the bustling world of our coffee shop, data tells a flavorful story of caffeine and customer behavior. Over the span of 1,133 clean and complete orders, 447 distinct customers walked in, choosing from 8 delightful varieties of coffee. Dominating the scene, card payments powered 91.5% of total revenue (₹34,322.88), leaving just ₹3,186 to cash—a rare brew in this digital-first crowd. Among all brews, Latte emerged as the top favorite, brewing ₹9,009.14 in revenue, followed closely by Americano with Milk and Cappuccino. May was the most vibrant month, steaming ahead with ₹9,063.42 from 267 cups, while Sundays and Wednesdays brewed the highest revenue among weekdays. The afternoons turned out to be the golden hours, stirring up ₹15,170.32, while mornings and evenings weren’t far behind. Interestingly, cash customers tended to pay slightly more per cup, perhaps choosing premium options or less frequent visits. Customer ANON-0000-0000-0012 proved to be our most loyal visitor, stopping by 88 times and contributing ₹2,593.18, followed by other regulars with more than 20 visits. In fact, 46 customers returned more than thrice, showing promising engagement. The average time between purchases was just 40 minutes, hinting at a constant hum of transactions. While card payments reigned across all coffee types, even the cash fans favored Lattes and Cappuccinos. As the steam rises and cups clink, this data-rich café hums with insights, loyalty, and the unmistakable aroma of opportunity.
