# Coffee Sales Data Analysis (By using MySQL)
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a coffee sales dataset using SQL. The dataset contains transactional details such as date, time, coffee type, payment method (cash/card), amount, and customer identifiers (card numbers). The analysis includes data cleaning (handling missing values, date formatting), summarization, trend identification, customer behavior analysis, and revenue insights. The project was executed in a structured SQL environment using MySQL.

Among all brews, Latte emerged as the top favorite, brewing ₹9,009.14 in revenue, followed closely by Americano with Milk and Cappuccino. May was the most vibrant month, steaming ahead with ₹9,063.42 from 267 cups, while Sundays and Wednesdays brewed the highest revenue among weekdays. The afternoons turned out to be the golden hours, stirring up ₹15,170.32, while mornings and evenings weren’t far behind. Interestingly, cash customers tended to pay slightly more per cup, perhaps choosing premium options or less frequent visits. Customer ANON-0000-0000-0012 proved to be our most loyal visitor, stopping by 88 times and contributing ₹2,593.18, followed by other regulars with more than 20 visits.
